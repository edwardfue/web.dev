    <p> Here are some projects that I work 
        on during my coding time in college.
        Note the code is still a working progress.
        Open for some suggestion on how to make the code 
        look better and run more effectively.

        <h1> GUI project - Mineswepper</h1>
        <p>
            Here is one of my favorite projects to do which was to make a simple game of Mineswepper.
            For those who never play Mineswepper it is a game in which you have to select a block and see if you 
            don't land on a bomb. And we have to program it using Java and we have to complete within a week. 
            It was really fun!
