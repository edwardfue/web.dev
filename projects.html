    <p> Here are some projects that I work 
        on during my coding time in college.
        Note the code is still a working progress.
        Open for some suggestion on how to make the code 
        look better and run more effectively.

    <div id="GUI Porject-> Mineswepper">
        <h1> GUI project - Mineswepper</h1>

        <p>
            Here is one of my favorite projects to do which was to make a simple game of Mineswepper.
            For those who never play Mineswepper it is a game in which you have to select a block and see if you 
            don't land on a bomb. And we have to program it using Java and we have to complete within a week. 
            It was really fun! 
        </p>

        <div id=" School DataBase project"></div>
        <h2> School Database project</h2>
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/edwar/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot%20(519).png" />
        
        <p>
            Heres another projects related to code and this was base on making a small version of a database
            for a school. This was very first java related project when coming to Lehman college. I was really hard at
            first but for a little while it was really good and had fun learn basic and intermediate java language.
